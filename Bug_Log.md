# New issues found in NVIDIA Driver 379.39.

As suspected, a incompatible video card has been detected.

The GTX 1050 Ti, will not be able to be installed into Kali Linux Systems, even with updated headers. 

Meanwhile the Laptop Geforce 840M is compatible with the latest drivers. 

Furthermore you do not want to manually install NVIDIA's proprietary drivers. they are not Debian ("Kali") supported.
